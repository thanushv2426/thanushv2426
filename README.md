# 👋 Hello, I’m Thanush


I’m a backend-focused developer with hands-on experience in both Java backend
development and the MERN stack. I enjoy building systems end-to-end — from
designing REST APIs and handling databases to creating clean user interfaces
when needed.

I’m currently focused on strengthening my backend fundamentals using Java and
Spring Boot, while also building full-stack projects with MongoDB, Express,
React, and Node.js. I believe in learning by building real projects and improving
them step by step.

📚 How I Learn & Build

I prefer building complete, functional projects rather than isolated demos.
My focus is on writing readable code, understanding application flow, and
improving structure over time instead of rushing features.
